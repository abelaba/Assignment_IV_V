        <p class="title">Should we use relative size or not?</p>
        <article class="">
          <p>In the past coding our font styles in pixels was bad because most browsers didnt have a zomm functionality
            and thus since pixels size has rigid stance if we said 16px the user wouldn't be able to see the text larger
            than 16px without the use of third-party software. So we needed to use relative sizes like percent(%), em and rem. But nowadays
            browser vendors have added in more features to allow us to create flexible designs.
            For example, browser zooming.When the user zooms the page in a modern browser,
            everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending on the user’s preference and thus we can code using pixels rather than relative sizes
            and we would get the same effect. </p>
