        <p class="title">Should we use relative size or not?</p>
        <article class="">
          <p>In the past coding our font styles in pixels was bad because most browsers didnt have a zomm functionality
            and thus since pixels size has rigid stance if we said 16px the user wouldn't be able to see the text larger
            than 16px without the use of third-party software. So we needed to use relative sizes like percent(%), em and rem. But nowadays
            browser vendors have added in more features to allow us to create flexible designs.
            For example, browser zooming.When the user zooms the page in a modern browser,
            everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending on the user’s preference and thus we can code using pixels rather than relative sizes
            and we would get the same effect. </p>

        <p class="title">CSS pixel</p>
        <article class="">
          <p>The “px” unit in CSS doesn't really have anything to do with screen pixels, despite the poorly chosen name. It's actually an non-linear angular measurement.
              The CSS pixel is a 'reference' pixel, not a device pixel.
              The thing to remember is that a CSS px is an abstract unit and there is a ratio controlling how it a) maps to actual device pixels and b) maps to physical units (in a fixed way, the ratio is always 96 CSS px to an inch).
              Pixel units are relative to the resolution of the viewing device.</p>
          <p>For a CSS device, dimensions are either anchored (i) by relating the physical units to their physical measurements, or (ii) by relating the pixel unit to the reference pixel. For print media and similar high-resolution devices, the anchor unit should be one of the standard physical units (inches, centimeters, etc). For lower-resolution devices, and devices with unusual viewing distances, it is recommended instead that the anchor unit be the pixel unit. For such devices it is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel.
          Note that if the anchor unit is the pixel unit, the physical units might not match their physical measurements.
           Alternatively if the anchor unit is a physical unit, the pixel unit might not map to a whole number of device pixels.</p>
